# pycrate

pycrate is a python library for manipulating various digital formats in an easy
way.

It provides basically a runtime for encoding and decoding data structures, including
CSN.1 and ASN.1. Additionally, it features a 3G and LTE mobile core network.

# Ongoing support

pycrate has been originally developed at ANSSI, but new releases are not
provided by the agency anymore. Active developers took the project in charge.

Therefore, anyone who wishes to get upstream versions of the project must visit
https://github.com/P1sec/pycrate as this page now **only serves archive
purposes**.

# Project archives
